  TapPilot is an auto-tapping utility app. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

  ## Data Collection
  **TapPilot does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** Specifically:

  - No personal information is collected
  - No usage data is tracked
  - No analytics or crash reporting services are used
  - No data is sent to any server
  - No internet connection is required

  ## Accessibility Service
  TapPilot uses Android's Accessibility Service solely to:
  - Simulate screen taps at user-specified locations
  - Take screenshots for the auto-stop feature (detecting screen changes)

  The Accessibility Service is used **exclusively** for these core app functions. No data from the Accessibility Service is collected, stored, or shared.

  ## Screenshots
  The auto-stop feature captures screenshots **only** to compare pixel changes at the tap location. These screenshots:
  - Are processed entirely on-device
  - Are immediately discarded after comparison
  - Are never stored, saved, or transmitted

  ## Third-Party Services
  TapPilot does not use any third-party services, SDKs, or libraries that collect user data.

  ## Children's Privacy
  TapPilot does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app or on our app listing.
